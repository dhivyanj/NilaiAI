## INNOVATION \& USP

*What is unique or innovative about your solution compared to existing ones*

## TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Privacy-First AI for Early Mental Well-Being Risk Detection*



- Passive Inputs: Sleep timing, activity rhythm, app usage patterns (metadata only)*



- Personal Baseline: AI learns each user’s normal routine (no population comparison)*



- ML Models: Unsupervised anomaly detection (Autoencoders, Isolation Forest)*



- Output: Early risk indicators \& trend changes (no diagnosis)*



- Ethics: No surveys, no content access, no medical labels* IMPACT \& BENEFITS
