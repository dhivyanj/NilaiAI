## PROPOSED SOLUTION
*What is your idea and how is that effective in solving the problem?*

* The user is asked a set of personal questions by the application by which the AI algorithm can identify the problem by assessing a set of parameters derived from the answers given and provide a diagnosis of his/her mental condition.
* The model is trained on the parameters which help us decide the mental condition of the user
* For e.g., if the user has anxiety and after he answers the questions of fills the necessary, the algorithm matches the parameters with the trained data to diagnose his mental condition.
